This is the brunt of our analysis.
Converts a sets of points to a Gaussian spherical function using sphericalGaussian()
Then expands that function into its spherical harmonic weights using sph_transform()
Then norms within each frequency to extract feature vectors.
```
featureVecs = [harmonicAnalysis(nf; l = 16, Î´ = 20) for nf in geo.nodalForces];

# cost matrix
costs = [norm(fv1 - fv2) for fv1 in featureVecs, fv2 in featureVecs];

# visualize distance matrix
costmap = heatmap(reverse(costs, dims = 1), 
    axis = (aspect = 1,
        xlabel = "Node ID",
        ylabel = "Node ID"))


# Clustering 
nclusters = 10

#concatenate all feature vectors
fvMatrix = hcat(featureVecs...)

# results of k-means clustering
kresults =  kmeans(fvMatrix, nclusters)

# assign each node to a cluster
kclusters = [findall(kresults.assignments .== i) for i = 1:nclusters]

#visualize
kclusterplot = clusterPlot(geo, kclusters)


# feature vectors in each cluster

# initial complexity score
